What does fork do ?
----------------------------------------

- Fork generates exact copy of the current process
- fork generated process differ from child procees with only by PID
- As Theory memory content is duplicated.
- But Linux uses Copy-On-Write that allow defering copy operations
  untill either parent or child writes to a page
