serving static we can use express.static middleware.

Single Folder
-------------
app.use(express.static('public'));

Multiple Folder
--------------
app.use(express.static('folder1'));
app.use(express.static('folder2'));

etc..

Virtual folder
--------------
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));

we can use like 
http://localhost:3000/static/images/bear.jpg

its safer to use absolute path if you use from another directory
because default is current directory.

app.use('/static', express.static(__dirname+'/public'));
