Source is Input
Sink is Output


Way we should think about
=========================
High (has paradigms,patterns)
Mid  (connections between things, components)
Low  (bit and pieces of works)

       o      o      <-   sources
     -------------
    \              /
     \            /
      \          /
       \        /
        ---------
          0- 0
           0   <- Sinks

Model/View/Intent
-----------------
   Intent 
     |
     v
   Models
     |
     v
    View 

Assume MVI as brain.....

Intent listens to impulse and it parses impulse streams to Model part.
Model part of brain constructs a Model from the impulse.
Once Model is constructed we respond with set of actions (view)

Watch porn is impulse
Model constructs as SexMood and imaginary scenario.
If imaginary scenario model is succeeded
we mastrubate. (which is view)
