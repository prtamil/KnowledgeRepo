When Generic function is called
-------------------------------
 CLOS takes charge of selecting implementation by
   1. Checking arguments
   2. finding applicable methods
   3. sorting them by order of precedence
   4. finally calling one or more of them.
        a. Calling before methods
        b. Calling primary methods
        c. Calling after methods
        d. return value of primary methods

This is called Generic Dispatch
