Rules
=====

(t <- standard-object <- Test)

Rule 1 of class precedence
---------------------------
   A class always has precedence over its superclass.

ex:
---
   ts will get precedence over standard-object.


Rule 2
-----
    Each class definition sets the precedence order
    of its direct superclasses.

 + Rule 1 does not indicate how to rank the direct
   superclasses, Rule 2 does

so 
      t <- standard-object <- Test <- TestMixin
                             (Order of superclass)
