Accessor
=========
  The term accessor generic function is an umberlla term that includes
  both readers and writers.

  For Read only slot we can define :reader
  For Both Read and Write we can use :accessor
  For Write only we use :writer


   CLOS generates two generic functions
   1. reader generic function
   2. writer generic function

   ex:
    (defclass Test()
       ((a :accessor a :initarg a :initform 10)))

    (defparameter inst (make-instance 'Test :a 20))
    
    ; reader generic function
    (a inst)
    ; writer generic function
    (setf (a inst) 30)
