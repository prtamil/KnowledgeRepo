CLOS is neatly integrated with existing CommonLisp Type Hierarchy

type-of  => Gives the type from object
typep    => verifies the type from object
subtypep => finds out relation between classes (not objects)

examples
    => (type-of *inst*)  => Test
    => (typep *inst* 'Test) => t
    => (subtypep 'DTest 'Test) => t t
        
subtypep =>
    if relationship between the two types is not known the value will be nil nil. 
    This can happen between CommonLisp Types bit never happen for two classes. 
    When both arguments to subtypep are classnames, the second value
    will be always be t.
