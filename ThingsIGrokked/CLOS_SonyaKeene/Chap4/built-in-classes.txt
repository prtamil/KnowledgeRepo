Builtin classes
---------------
   it is implemented different 
   classes defined with defclass are different with built-in-class.

   built-in-classes follow
    + multiple-inheritance
    + have instances
    + inherit from class t
    + we can define methods that specialize on them
    
Differences between built-in-class vs user-defined-class:
---------------------------------------------------------
Structure => 
    + structure of user defined class is in form of slots.
    + for built-in-class it is not.

Creation of Instances =>
    + user defined class use make-instance to create instance
    + built-in class use independent mechanism (such as cons)
    + you cannot use make-instance for built-in-class.

Use as a SuperClas =>
    + CLOS does not allow you to include a build-in class as
      a direct superclass of any user-defined classe.
      (the only exception to this rule is the class named t,
        which is superclass to everyclass)

Inheritance from standard-object =>
     + user-classes has a default superclass (standard-object).
     + built-in-classes have no superclass named standard-object.

Ex: usage of built-in classes 
   + use as specialization in methods

(defmethod encode ((num integer) stream))
(defmethod encode ((char character)stream))
(defmethod encode ((list list) stream))
(defmethod encode ((vector vector)stream))
