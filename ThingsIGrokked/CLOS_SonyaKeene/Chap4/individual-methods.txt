Method for individual Lisp objects
---------------------------------
    we can specialize on an individual lisp object.
This kind of method is called an individual method.

;1
(defmethod divide ((divident number) (zero (eql 0)))
  (error "Cannot divide by zero"))
;2
(defmethod divide ((divident number) (divisor number))
  (/ divident divisor))

1 => is called individual method.

lambda list for individual method => (var (eql form))

Rule of applicability of an individual method:
=============================================
 For a parameter specializer of the form (eql object), the
 argument to the generc function satisfies the parameter 
specializer if the argument is eql to the object.
In other words,
 The expression such as (eql argument 'object) should be true.

Rule of precedence of an individual method:
==========================================
 When 2 parameter specializers are compared, 
 a parameter specializer of the form (eql object) is always
 more specific than a class

 if eql object (object is a form , the form gets evaulated 
         only once, while defined).
