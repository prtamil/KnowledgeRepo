Classes and Types
=====================
  Class and Types are two different thing.
  It is not the same. although it looks like the same.

 By CLOS for some type we have equalavent class.
 But not for all types.

If commonlisp doesnot have a corresponding class you cannot
define a method that specializes on that type.
