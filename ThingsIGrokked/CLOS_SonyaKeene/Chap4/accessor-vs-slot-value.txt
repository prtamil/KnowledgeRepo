slot-value
==========
 slot-value accesses the slot directly without calling any accessor methods.

   Can read any slot using slot-value,
   can write any slot using (setf (slot-value x) new-x)

 accessors are advertised interface
 slot-value is the underlying implementation of accesors.

 if developer changes slot names accessor is the way
 methods can work without change. else we need to change code in methods
 which defeats the purpose of OO.
