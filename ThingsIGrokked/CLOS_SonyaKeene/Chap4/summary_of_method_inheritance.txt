Summary
=======
   + Inheritance of Methods involve 2 seperate mechanisms

1. Selecting the set of applicable methods.
   + General rule of method applicability
     (A method is applicable if each of its 
         + required parameter 
         + should satisfiy by the corresponding argument
         + to the generic function.)

     | Required Parameter | Test                    |
     | ---                | ---                     |
     | (var (eql form))   | (eql arg 'object)       |
     | (var class-name)   | (typep arg 'class-name) |
     | var                | (typep arg 't)          |

2. Ranking the applicable methods in order of precedence.
    + To rank CLOS Requires
       + Set of applicable methods
       + class precedence list of the class of each req arg to generic fun.
       + argument precedence order of generic function
          + Left to right
    + Rule of Ranking parameter specializers:
       + A Parameter specializer of (eql object) is more specific than a class.
       + When both parameter specializers are classes. They ranked
          + according to class precedence list of class (w.r of generic fn)
          + The class precedence list indicates which class is more 
            specific than other.
