Data Inheritance Technique (Not Functions only Data)
==========================
  Lately have been working in Bluetooth project.Found out Beautiful Solution for Inheritance
like solution in C/C++.
  This thing is absolutely beautiful because it says excatly what pointer is

Solution
=========
   
  struct Base
  {
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
  };

struct Derived
{
  int a;
  int b;
  int c;
  int d;
};

Base *bp = new Derived();

bp->a = 10;
bp->b = 20;
bp->c = 30;

Derived *dp;
dp = bp;
dp->d = 40;

cout<<dp->a<<dp->b<<dp->c<<dp->d<<endl; 
//Print 10,20,30,40.

Analysis
=========
  when we are allocating memmory we are creating sizeblock.
but when we refereing to structure whe just refereing to memory its created.
  So if multiple struct has similar alighment , say some base fields aligned in 
same position we can use different struct pointers to hold these things.

So Base and Derived no need to be connected via public derived.
we can make use of pointer to struct in similar fashion to use it as inheritance.

its called Data Inheritance not Class inheritance.
Quite refreshing the new thought.
