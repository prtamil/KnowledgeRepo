ASLR -> Address Space Layout Randomization
     -> To prevent prediction of memory address for exploitation

its defined in

/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

   Values are  0    -> No randomization and Everything Static
               1    -> Conservative randomization , mmap,stack,VDSO(Virtual Dynamic Shared Object), and heap are randomized
               2    -> Full Randomization of parts mention in 1 as well as memory managed thru brk() also randomized

How do we set values
--------------------
echo 1 > sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomiz_va_space 

But this will be changed to default while reboot 
inorder to survive reboot we need to add file 

/etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf  -> contaiks

kernel.randomize_va_space = 0

should permenantly disable this
