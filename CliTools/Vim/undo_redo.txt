use 'u' for undo

:changes   -> display changes made
:undolist  -> displays lists of undo
:undo num  -> specify number from list makes redo possible

Ctrl+R   -> Redo

:earlier  -> previous
:later    -> later

:earlier 10s  -> goto 10s earlier
:later 10s    -> goto 10s after 
                 (most probably later should use after earlier which will make sense)
